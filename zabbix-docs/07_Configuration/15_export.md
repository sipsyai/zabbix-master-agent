# 15 Data export

#### Overview

Zabbix supports data export in real-time in two ways:

  * [export to files](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/export/files)
  * [streaming to external systems](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/export/streaming)

The following entities can be exported:

  * trigger events
  * item values
  * trends (export to files only)
