# 1 Conditions  
  
#### Overview

It is possible to define that an action is executed only if the event matches a defined set of conditions. Conditions are set when configuring the [action](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/notifications/action#configuring-an-action).

Condition matching is case-sensitive.

#### Trigger actions

The following conditions can be used in trigger-based actions:

_Host group_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify host groups or host groups to exclude.  
**equals** \- event belongs to this host group.  
**does not equal** \- event does not belong to this host group.  
Specifying a parent host group implicitly selects all nested host groups. To specify the parent group only, all nested groups have to be additionally set with the **does not equal** operator.  
---|---|---  
_Template_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify templates or templates to exclude.  
**equals** \- event belongs to a trigger inherited from this template.  
**does not equal** \- event does not belong to a trigger inherited from this template.  
_Host_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify hosts or hosts to exclude.  
**equals** \- event belongs to this host.  
**does not equal** \- event does not belong to this host.  
_Tag name_ | equals  
does not equal  
contains  
does not contain | Specify event tag or event tag to exclude.  
**equals** \- event has this tag.  
**does not equal** \- event does not have this tag.  
**contains** \- event has a tag containing this string.  
**does not contain** \- event does not have a tag containing this string.  
_Tag value_ | equals  
does not equal  
contains  
does not contain | Specify event tag and value combination or tag and value combination to exclude.  
**equals** \- event has this tag and value.  
**does not equal** \- event does not have this tag and value.  
**contains** \- event has a tag and value containing these strings.  
**does not contain** \- event does not have a tag and value containing these strings.  
_Trigger_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify triggers or triggers to exclude.  
**equals** \- event is generated by this trigger.  
**does not equal** \- event is generated by any other trigger, except this one.  
_Event name_ | contains  
does not contain | Specify a string in the name of the event generated by the trigger or a string to exclude. By default, the event name matches the trigger name unless a custom event name is specified in [trigger configuration](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/triggers/trigger).  
**contains** \- event name contains this string.  
**does not contain** \- this string is excluded from the event name.  
Note: Entered value will be compared to event name with all macros expanded.  
_Trigger severity_ | equals  
does not equal

**in** \- event time is within the time period.  
**not in** \- event time is not within the time period.  
See the [time period specification](/documentation/current/en/manual/appendix/time_period) page for description of the format.  
[User macros](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/macros/user_macros) are supported.  
_Problem is suppressed_ | no  
yes | Specify if the problem is suppressed (not shown) because of host maintenance.

does not equal | Specify a service or a service to exclude.  
**equals** \- event belongs to this service.  
**does not equal** \- event does not belong to this service.  
Specifying a parent service implicitly selects all child services. To specify the parent service only, all nested services have to be additionally set with the **does not equal** operator.  
---|---|---  
_Service name_ | contains  
does not contain | Specify a string in the service name or a string to exclude.

Make sure to define [message templates](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/notifications/media#overview) for Service actions in the _Alerts → Media types_ menu. Otherwise, the notifications will not be sent.

#### Discovery actions

The following conditions can be used in discovery-based events:

**equals** \- using this discovery rule.  
**does not equal** \- using any other discovery rule, except this one.  
_Discovery check_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify a discovery check or a discovery check to exclude.  
**equals** \- using this discovery check.  
**does not equal** \- using any other discovery check, except this one.  
_Discovery object_ | equals | Specify the discovered object.  
**equals** \- equal to discovered object (a device or a service).  
_Discovery status_ | equals | **Up** \- matches 'Host Up' and 'Service Up' events.  
**Down** \- matches 'Host Down' and 'Service Down' events.  
**Discovered** \- matches 'Host Discovered' and 'Service Discovered' events.  
**Lost** \- matches 'Host Lost' and 'Service Lost' events.  
_Uptime/Downtime_ | is greater than or equals  
is less than or equals | Uptime for 'Host Up' and 'Service Up' events. Downtime for 'Host Down' and 'Service Down' events.  
**is greater than or equals** \- is more or equal to. Parameter is given in seconds.  
**is less than or equals** \- is less or equal to. Parameter is given in seconds.  
_Received value_ | equals  
does not equal  
is greater than or equals  
is less than or equals  
contains  
does not contain | Specify the value received from an agent (Zabbix, SNMP) check in a discovery rule. String comparison. If several Zabbix agent or SNMP checks are configured for a rule, received values for each of them are checked (each check generates a new event which is matched against all conditions).  
**equals** \- equal to the value.  
**does not equal** \- not equal to the value.  
**is greater than or equals** \- more or equal to the value.  
**is less than or equals** \- less or equal to the value.

**does not contain** \- does not contain the substring. Parameter is given as a string.  
_Proxy_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify a proxy or a proxy to exclude.  
**equals** \- using this proxy.  
**does not equal** \- using any other proxy except this one.  
  
Service checks in a discovery rule, which result in discovery events, do not take place simultaneously. Therefore, if **multiple** values are configured for `Service type`, `Service port` or `Received value` conditions in the action, they will be compared to one discovery event at a time, but **not** to several events simultaneously. As a result, actions with multiple values for the same check types may not be executed correctly.

does not contain  
matches  
does not match | Specify host metadata or host metadata to exclude.  
**contains** \- host metadata contains the string.  
**does not contain** \- host metadata does not contain the string.  
Host metadata can be specified in an [agent configuration file](/documentation/current/en/manual/appendix/config/zabbix_agentd).

#### Internal event actions

The following conditions can be set for actions based on internal events:

**Low-level discovery rule in "not supported" state** \- matches events where a low-level discovery rule goes from a 'normal' to 'not supported' state.  
**Trigger in "unknown" state** \- matches events where a trigger goes from a 'normal' to 'unknown' state.

_Host_ | equals  
does not equal | Specify hosts or hosts to exclude.  
**equals** \- event belongs to this host.  
**does not equal** \- event does not belong to this host.  
  
#### Type of calculation

The following options of calculating conditions are available:

  * **And** \- all conditions must be met

Note that using "And" calculation is disallowed between several triggers when they are selected as a `Trigger=` condition. Actions can only be executed based on the event of one trigger.

  * **Or** \- enough if one condition is met
  * **And/Or** \- combination of the two: AND with different condition types and OR with the same condition type, for example:

_Host group_ equals Oracle servers  
_Host group_ equals MySQL servers  
_Event name_ contains 'Database is down'  
_Event name_ contains 'Database is unavailable'

is evaluated as

**(** Host group equals Oracle servers **or** Host group equals MySQL servers**)** **and** **(** Event name contains 'Database is down' **or** Event name contains 'Database is unavailable'**)**

  * **Custom expression** \- a user-defined calculation formula for evaluating action conditions. It must include all conditions (represented as uppercase letters A, B, C, ...) and may include spaces, tabs, brackets ( ), **and** (case sensitive), **or** (case sensitive), **not** (case sensitive).

While the previous example with `And/Or` would be represented as (A or B) and (C or D), in a custom expression you may as well have multiple other ways of calculation:

(A and B) and (C or D)  
(A and B) or (C and D)  
((A or B) and C) or D  
(not (A or B) and C) or not D  
etc.

#### Deleting objects used in actions

When attempting to delete objects that are used in an action condition/operation, the user will receive a corresponding error message.

Actions are not disabled if action conditions or operations:

  * have deleted objects;
  * have objects that are no longer discovered by low-level discovery and have been removed (after the _Delete lost resources_ period).

Action conditions/operations are not removed if they have missing objects. Instead, deleted objects are displayed as _Deleted host group_ , _Deleted host_ , _Deleted trigger_ , etc. A warning icon with message "This action has conditions or operations referencing deleted object(s)." is displayed in the "Info" column of the action list.
