# 1 Graphs

#### Overview

With lots of data flowing into Zabbix, it becomes much easier for the users if they can look at a visual representation of what is going on rather than only numbers.

This is where graphs come in. Graphs allow to grasp the data flow at a glance, correlate problems, discover when something started or make a presentation of when something might turn into a problem.

Zabbix provides users with:

  * built-in [simple graphs](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/visualization/graphs/simple) of one item data
  * the possibility to create more complex [customized graphs](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/visualization/graphs/custom)
  * access to a comparison of several items quickly in [ad-hoc graphs](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/visualization/graphs/adhoc)
  * modern customizable vector [graphs](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets/graph) and [pie charts](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets/pie_chart)
