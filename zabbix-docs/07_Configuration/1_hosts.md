# 1 Hosts and host groups

#### What is a "host"?

In Zabbix, a "host" refers to any physical or virtual device, application, service, or any other logically-related collection of monitored parameters.

Creating hosts is one of the first monitoring tasks in Zabbix. For example, if you want to monitor some parameters on a server "x", you must first create a host called, say, "Server X" and then you can look to add monitoring items to it.

Hosts are organized into host groups.

Proceed to:

  * [Host Wizard](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/hosts/host_wizard) for a guided, step-by-step interface for creating and configuring a new or existing host.
  * [Configuring a host](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/hosts/host) for a classic approach to creating and configuring a host.
