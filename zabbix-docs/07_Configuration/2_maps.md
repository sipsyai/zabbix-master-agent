# 2 Network maps

#### Overview

If you have a network to look after, you may want to have an overview of your infrastructure somewhere. For that purpose, you can create maps in Zabbix - of networks and of anything you like.

All users can create network maps. The maps can be public (available to all users) or private (available to selected users).

Proceed to [configuring a network map](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/visualization/maps/map).
