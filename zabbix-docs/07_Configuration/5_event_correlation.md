# 5 Event correlation

#### Overview

Event correlation allows to correlate problem events to their resolution in a manner that is very precise and flexible.

Event correlation can be defined:

  * [on trigger level](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/event_correlation/trigger) \- one trigger may be used to relate separate problems to their solution
  * [globally](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/event_correlation/global) \- problems can be correlated to their solution from a different trigger/polling method using global correlation rules
