#### Overview

In addition to the parameters that are [common](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets#common-parameters) for all widgets, you may set the following specific options:

_Map_ | Set a map to display.  
Alternatively, select a compatible widget as the [data source](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets/#dynamic-parameters) for the map to display.  
This field is auto-complete, so starting to type the name of the map or widget will offer a dropdown of matching maps or widgets.
