# 1 Overview

#### Overview

The _Inventory → Overview_ section provides ways of having an overview of [host inventory](/documentation/current/en/manual/config/hosts/inventory) data.

For an overview to be displayed, choose host groups (or none) and the inventory field by which to display data. The number of hosts corresponding to each entry of the chosen field will be displayed.

The completeness of an overview depends on how much inventory information is maintained with the hosts.

Numbers in the _Host count_ column are links; they lead to these hosts being filtered out in the _Host Inventories_ table.
