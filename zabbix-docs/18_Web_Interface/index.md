# 18 Web interface

### Overview

For an easy access to Zabbix from anywhere and from any platform, the web-based interface is provided.

If using more than one frontend instance make sure that the locales and libraries (LDAP, SAML etc.) are installed and configured identically for all frontends.

### Frontend help

A help link ![](/documentation/current/assets/en/manual/web_interface/help_link.png) is provided in Zabbix frontend forms with direct links to the corresponding parts of the documentation.
