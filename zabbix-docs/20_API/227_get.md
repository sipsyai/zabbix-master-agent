# problem.get  
  
### Description

`integer/array problem.get(object parameters)`

The method allows to retrieve problems according to the given parameters.

This method is for retrieving unresolved problems. It is also possible, if specified, to additionally retrieve recently resolved problems. The period that determines how old is "recently" is defined in _Administration_ → _[General](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/administration/general#trigger-displaying-options)_. Problems that were resolved prior to that period are not kept in the problem table. To retrieve problems that were resolved further back in the past, use the [`event.get`](/documentation/current/en/manual/api/reference/event/get) method.

This method may return problems of a deleted entity if these problems have not been removed by the housekeeper yet.

This method is available to users of any type. Permissions to call the method can be revoked in user role settings. See [User roles](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/users/user_roles) for more information.

### Parameters

`(object)` Parameters defining the desired output.

The method supports the following parameters.

eventids | ID/array | Return only problems with the given IDs.  
---|---|---  
groupids | ID/array | Return only problems created by objects that belong to the given host groups.  
hostids | ID/array | Return only problems created by objects that belong to the given hosts.  
objectids | ID/array | Return only problems created by the given objects.  
source | integer | Return only problems with the given type.  
  
Refer to the [problem event object page](object#problem) for a list of supported event types.  
  
Default: 0 - problem created by a trigger.  
object | integer | Return only problems created by objects of the given type.  
  
Refer to the [problem event object page](object#problem) for a list of supported object types.  
  
Default: 0 - trigger.  
acknowledged | boolean | `true` \- return acknowledged problems only;  
`false` \- unacknowledged only.  
action | integer | Return only problems for which the given [event update actions](/documentation/current/en/manual/api/reference/event/acknowledge#parameters) have been performed. For multiple actions, use a sum of any acceptable bitmap values as bitmask (for example, 34 for acknowledge and suppress event).  
action_userids | ID/array | Return only problems with the given IDs of users who performed the problem event update actions.  
suppressed | boolean | `true` \- return only suppressed problems;  
`false` \- return problems in the normal state.  
symptom | boolean | `true` \- return only symptom problem events;  
`false` \- return only cause problem events.  
severities | integer/array | Return only problems with given event severities. Applies only if object is trigger.  
evaltype | integer | Tag [evaluation method](/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/monitoring/problems#using-filter).  
  
Possible values:  
0 - _(default)_ And/Or;  
2 - Or.  
tags | array | Return only problems with the given tags.  
Format: `[{"tag": "<tag>", "value": "<value>", "operator": "<operator>"}, ...]`.

0 - _(default)_ Contains;  
1 - Equals;  
2 - Does not contain;  
3 - Does not equal;  
4 - Exists;  
5 - Does not exist.  
recent | boolean | `true` \- return PROBLEM and recently RESOLVED problems (depends on Display OK triggers for N seconds)  
Default: `false` \- UNRESOLVED problems only  
eventid_from | string | Return only problems with IDs greater or equal to the given ID.  
eventid_till | string | Return only problems with IDs less or equal to the given ID.  
time_from | timestamp | Return only problems that have been created after or at the given time.  
time_till | timestamp | Return only problems that have been created before or at the given time.  
selectAcknowledges | query | Return an `acknowledges` property with the problem updates. Problem updates are sorted in reverse chronological order.  
  
The problem update object has the following properties:  
`acknowledgeid` \- `(ID)` ID of the update;  
`userid` \- `(ID)` ID of the user that updated the event;  
`eventid` \- `(ID)` ID of the updated event;  
`clock` \- `(timestamp)` time when the event was updated;  
`message` \- `(string)` text of the message;  
`action` \- `(integer)`type of update action (see [`event.acknowledge`](/documentation/current/en/manual/api/reference/event/acknowledge));

`new_severity` \- `(integer)` event severity after this update action;  
`suppress_until` \- `(timestamp)` time till event will be suppressed;  
`taskid` \- `(ID)` ID of the task if the current event is undergoing a rank change.  
  
Supports `count`.  
selectTags | query | Return a [`tags`](/documentation/current/en/manual/api/reference/problem/object#problem-tag) property with the problem tags. Output format: `[{"tag": "<tag>", "value": "<value>"}, ...]`.  
selectSuppressionData | query | Return a `suppression_data` property with the list of active maintenances and manual suppressions:  
`maintenanceid` \- `(ID)` ID of the maintenance;  
`userid` \- `(ID)` ID of user who suppressed the problem;  
`suppress_until` \- `(integer)` time until the problem is suppressed.  
filter | object | Return only those results that exactly match the given filter.  
  
Accepts an object, where the keys are property names, and the values are either a single value or an array of values to match against.  
  
Does not support properties of `text` [data type](/documentation/current/en/manual/api/reference_commentary#data-types).  
sortfield | string/array | Sort the result by the given properties.  
  
Possible values: `eventid`.  
countOutput | boolean | These parameters are described in the [reference commentary](/documentation/current/en/manual/api/reference_commentary#common-get-method-parameters).  
editable | boolean  
excludeSearch | boolean  
limit | integer  
output | query  
preservekeys | boolean  
search | object  
searchByAny | boolean

### Return values

`(integer/array)` Returns either:
